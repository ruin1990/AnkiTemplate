# ClozeAdv
Now, we can touch one by one cloze if a card have multi-clozes.

## Usage
1. You can import file AnkiTemplate_ClozeAdv.apkg
2. Just change you own Cloze Template front content with my front.html

https://github.com/ruin1990/AnkiTemplate/ClozeAdv/front.html


## Features
It can support multi-cloze sperate by c[n], some template will convert all the c[n] to c1

## Bugs
ClozeAdv cannot support MathJax formulation cloze or some complex span/div.
So, I skip the MathJax's convertion.

## Compatibility

|   AnkiMobile   | Not test, but I think it's supported |
|  AnkiWindows    | **YES** |
