## Features
1. We can use touch/click/keyboard(Tab and Backquote) to reveal or cover the cloze.(Thanks: [kleinerpirat](https://forums.ankiweb.net/t/cloze-one-by-one-uncovering/12584))
2. If all the clozes are revealed, the card will auto flip to back.(Thanks: [git9527](https://github.com/git9527/anki-awesome-select))
3. I add a flow button view for reveal next cloze or cover previous cloze.(Thanks: [kleinerpirat](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1231171279))
